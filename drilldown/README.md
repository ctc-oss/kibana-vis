# `drilldown`

## Description

Tools used in `radar-visualizer` and `line-visualizer` to generate drilldown data to present within their components.

## Usage

The drilldown package contains two functions: `fetchQuery` and `getDrilldownInfo`. `fetchQuery` is used for building an array of query results from ElasticSearch, whereas `getDrilldownInfo` is used to build a drilldown URL for a visualization of your liking.

Documentation (parameters, return type, etc.) can be found above each function in the source code.
